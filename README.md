#Find-Similar-Doctor
A website that allows users to search for a doctor based on the doctors location, specialty, name or rating

##Assumptions:
a) the patient is looking for a specific specialty of doctors. So that the recommendation is mainly based on specialty. 
b) the patient is always looking for doctors that have higher rating. So when search by rating, it will return all doctors that has higher ratings than the input
c) doctorsâ€™ information are generated by randomly selecting some value from a pool. For areas that are not used for query, same values are used for all doctors.

##Future Enhancement:
a)Enable querying with more than one criterion. 
b)The result of the recommendation could be grouped by cities starting with the same city as the person looked for
c)Use real database instead of static json
d)Enable sorting e.g. by rating 
e)Add more details about a doctor, e.g add a picture and personal website
f)More interactive UI
